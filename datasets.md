### Historical hourly weather
  - **description** : based on a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data) dataset. The dataset contains ~5 years of high temporal resolution (hourly measurements) of various types of indicators, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, weather description. All for a set of 36 cities in North America and the Middle East. In the Kaggle dataset, weather description is a categorial textual feature and reports a "human" annotation of the weather. In the initial set, about fifty annotations were available, such as "high wind", "light rain", "good weather", "snowfall" ... In our datset, these features have been grouped into 5 classes ("good weather", "clouds" or "wind", "rain", "snow", "extreme conditions") and then transformed in integer by a OneHotEncoding step.
